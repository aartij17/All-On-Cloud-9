Implementation Specific Notes

APPLICATION:
- Each application maintains 2 sets of records:
	- Public: Replicated on all applications
	- Private: Accessible only to the application
----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
BLOCKCHAIN LEDGER:
- Append-only data structure, recording transactions in the form of a hash chain
- Every blockchain starts with a Genesis block
- Each block contains:
	- Batch of transactions(in case of CAPER, only 1 transaction per block)
	- The blockchain ledger consists of both internal and cross-application transactions
- Model the ledger as a directed acyclic graph(DAG)
----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
TRANSACTIONS:
- Internal transaction includes the cryptographic hash of a cross application transaction in the ledger
(When internal transaction has to use the data of cross application transactions).
- Includes:
	- To show that a transaction t includes H(t'), we include an esge from t to t' in the DAG
	- Transaction ID: t<i><j>: i: order of the transaction among those initiated by the initiator app
	j: order of transaction among cross-application transactions.
- 2 types of Transactions
	- Internal: Performed within an application. Can R/W its private records
	- Cross-application: Involve multiple applications and are visible to all applications. Public
	  records can only be updated via Cross-Application transactions
----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
MESSAGES:
- contain public-key signatures and message digests
- Message digest: numeric representation of contents of a message
- Assume that all machines have access to public keys of all other machines
----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
ARCHITECTURE:
- Each application runs on a disjoint subset of nodes(agents)
- All applications, there exists Na intersect Nb == NULL
- Nodes are connected by bidirectional communication channels[DEPLOYMENT DETAILS]
- Network channels are pairwise authenticated
----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
BEHAVIOUR:
- At the node level, each agent might be crash-only, Byzantine, or a reliable node.
- At the application level, the application might behave maliciously.
- These 2 behaviours are independent of each other
----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
CONSENSUS:
- Ordering the transactions within each application needs consensus among the agents of that
particular application.
- PAXOS and PBFT (from the Bi-partite PAXOS paper)
----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
LOCAL CONSENSUS:
- Internal transactions are ordered and executed in CAPER using consensus algorithms.
- The application can also NOT use a consensus protocol and instead rely on a single
non-faulty reliable node to order the transactions.
- The local consensus protocol of an application is initiated by one of the agents - called the
primary.
-------------
Process:
- client c -> requests internal transaction tx -> signed(<REQUEST, tx, Tc, c>) to agent p
		- Tc: client's timestamp - used to totally order the requests of each client and to ensure exactly-once semantics
		- signed: Entire message is signed with signature
- Primary p receives the request -> check signature to ensure it is valid -> initiate local consensus algo
- To provide total order b/w transactions, p also includes H(t) in the message
- More details about the message above under the "MESSAGE" section.
- The agents then establish agreement on a total order of transactions using the utilized consensus protocol, execute
transaction, and append to the blockchain ledger.
- Finally, either the primary/every agent node send a reply message signed(<REPLY, Tc, u>) to client
where u is the execution result.
----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
GLOBAL CONSENSUS:
3 ways to do this:
------------
Orderers
------------
- disjoint set of nodes which are not agents of any applications.
- these are used to globally order cross application transactions
